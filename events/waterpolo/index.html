            Hi guys!<br />
<br />
Interhouse waterpolo for years 7 - 10 will be taking place after May 16th. 
(Exact dates will be announced later, but games will most likely be played 
during lunch times.)<br />
<br />
Waterpolo is not as hard as it seems. You do not necessarily have to be a great 
swimmer (although being able to swim really helps). There are 7 players in a 
team. One girl must be playing at all times. To summarise the main rules, you 
must catch and throw the ball with one hand, and you can&#39;t score if you are 
standing. If you push the ball under water, the other team gets the ball. Other 
rules can be found on the notice board outside the staff room (next to the beep 
test results). <br />
<br />
The Upsdell seniors have done really well, standing in 2nd place after Rowell in 
1st, followed closely by Crozier then Nightingale. <br />
The points between the houses are very close and there is a very good chance 
that we can come first overall!<br />
<br />
So to those of you who are interested in taking part, please email jlo@kgv.net 
or chunter1@kgv.net and we will put you on the team.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, email us as well and we&#39;ll reply ASAP. <br />
<br />
Thanks Upsdell!<br />
Your waterpolo captains.</blockquote>
