        <h5>&#39;Selling&#39; the Upsdell site</h5>
        <h6>It&#39;s all about ease</h6>
        <p>Web surfers, regardless of age, want their life to be easy. It is
        therefore our main goal to make the website as easy to use as possible
        so that everyone benefits.</p>
        <h6>It has what you want</h6>
        <p>The Upsdell site has more information available than any other house
        sites. This means the availability of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Events<ul>
                <li>Rehearsal times</li>
                <li>Progress tracking and <a href="../events/chinese_chess/">
                practice toolkits</a></li>
                <li>Results</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Captains<ul>
                <li>Searching by event</li>
                <li><a href="../captains/index2.htm">Looking up by name</a></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="../resources/">Photo</a>, <a href="../events/music/">
            Video</a> and <a href="../resources/index.html#Posters">cultural</a>
            impact</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most importantly, this site <strong>
        <a href="#The_current_specification_(2007-2008)">fulfills every part of
        the specification</a></strong> as posted on the KGV main site before
        school (2007) started.</p>
        <h6>Surf without getting lost</h6>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A back hyperlink is available on every page</strong> so
            that the users know where they are and where they went, and that
            they won&#39;t be scared while surfing deeper into the site for more
            interesting information.</li>
            <li>The website structure is amazingly simple and is URL-friendly.
            For example, <a href="http://www.kgv.edu.hk/upsdell/captains">
            http://www.kgv.edu.hk/upsdell/<strong>captains</strong></a><strong>
            </strong>gets you exactly what you would expect.</li>
            <li>Visited hyperlinks are, as recommended, grayed/greyed out.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamically adjustable font sizes </strong>are there for
            the older audience.<ul>
                <li>As for the default font size, since the major target is the
                student body in the school itself, it has been set to a smaller
                size (10 pixels) than mature content sites. This is also the
                same font size as established sites, such as                 <a href="http://www.msn.com">MSN</a>,
                <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> and
                <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>.</li>
                <li>The site has been made like other web pages as to <strong>
                reduce the learning time</strong> for new visitors.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h6>No more than 3 clicks</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>The Upsdell website contents are, as recommended, nothing more
            than 3 clicks away.</li>
            <li>Certain pages with heavy content, such as the
            <a href="../captains/">captains</a> page or the <a href="../events/">
            events</a> page, come with either a <strong>searching script</strong>
            or an <strong>interactive display</strong>  that will help the user
            understand what they are doing.</li>
            <li>Older content are flushed out of the home page and is put
            elsewhere so the first impression is never cluttered.</li>
            <li><a href="specs.htm#Privacy_policy">We give people credits</a>
            for helping the Upsdell web site, and make it clear to people what
            they can copy by using a copyright notice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>It always shows</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Having been rigorously tested with online agents, this site is
            written in <strong>XHTML</strong> in such a way that it shows just
            as it is on every browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Anyone with JavaScript disabled can still surf the site</strong>.</li>
            <li>This site is CSS 2.1 compliant and adds one line of IE-specific
            code for handling transparency.</li>
        </ul>
        <h6><a name="The_current_specification_(2007-2008)">The current
        specification (2007-2008)</a></h6>
            <ul>
                <li>A <a href="../index.html">homepage for your House</a>, showing
                <a href="../index.html">photos</a> of those very hard
                working people who are the Heads of House with their deputies
                (i.e. Head Girl and Boy plus each deputy)</li>
                <li>A page to show the names of the <a href="../captains/">Captains of each activity</a>,
                i.e. Name of the boy and girl heading for example, &quot;Music&quot;</li>
                <li style="list-style:none;padding:4px 20px 4px 10px;color:green;font-size:small">
                I wanted to send a note to the debating captains. Unable to get
                the info from Nightingale or Crozier - under construction.
                Rowell looked more promising - until I realised it was last
                year&#39;s info! Upsdell was the only site that was able to provide
                the information that I wanted (not that I&#39;m biased) It is six
                weeks since the start of term... by the time the sites are
                finished no-one will need to know.. </li>
                <li>A page to show the names of the
                <a href="../captains/index.html#Year_coordinators">Year Coordinators</a> plus the
                names of the Form Representatives</li>
                <li>The site should be easy to navigate for those more
                <a href="noob.htm#Who,_what,_when,_where,_why,_and_how">techno
                phobic</a> amongst us</li>
                <li>The site should reflect the colours and aims of the House
                represented</li>
                <li>Each house should submit one site only</li>
                <li>Younger students wishing to participate should <a href="mailto:blai@kgv.net">
                contact their own House Web Team</a> from Year 13.</li>
                <li>The site will be judged on presentation,
                <a href="#Privacy_policy">technical merit</a> and
                the ability to meet the above requirements</li>
                <li>Further details may be posted to this area of the school
                website so check it now and again!!</li>
                <li>The websites will be checked periodically by Miss Block
                (approximately every 2 months) so keep them up to date</li>
            </ul>
        <h6>Proudly self-written</h6>
        <p>The entire website has been made by a <a href="specs.htm">single
        person</a>, including the code, the javascript, and mainframe structure,
        without copying a single line of code. This is unachieved by any other
        houses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.kgv.edu.hk/crozier">Crozier</a>: I made
            their iFrame <em>onClick</em> event...</li>
