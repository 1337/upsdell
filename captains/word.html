                        <h5>A word from the former Upsdell house captain</h5>
                        <blockquote>Upsdell came into the 2006-2007 school year,
                            as they say, ready to rock: having given the other
                            houses their time to shine after winning a
                            tremendous streak of three years in a row, Upsdell
                            looked enthused and back in fighting form for the
                            ultimate House Cup. Though the beginning of the year
                            saw some lack of success, it is perhaps Upsdell’s
                            perseverance that has pulled us back in to the thick
                            of the House competition!<br />
                            <br />
                            Upsdell brought their spirit and enthusiasm to the
                            first big event of the year: the Swimming Gala. With
                            face paint, hair dye, ribbons and banners, the House
                            of Red brimmed with enthusiasm, cheering as loud as
                            possible for our rouge-capped swimmers as they sped
                            across the pool in Kowloon Tsai. Unfortunately, even
                            the cheery cheerleaders’ chants and cool dance moves
                            couldn’t change the results, as Upsdell finished in
                            fourth place.<br />
                            <br />
                            Despite the outstanding participation that
                            Upsdellians showed (even if it did involve the house
                            captains to drag unwilling victims onto the field to
                            run), our House did not place any better in the
                            Cross Country, coming fourth again. <br />
                            <br />
                            Upsdell’s fortunes were to take a pivotal turn in
                            November, when we sang, danced, and played our
                            instruments during the Inter-house Music
                            competition. With our delightfully cute Juniors
                            singing All Star, our Seniors doing That Thing You
                            Do, as well as our individually talented musicians
                            strutting their stuff, we were confident that we’d
                            done considerably well. It was then when Upsdell
                            managed to move up to third place. We managed to
                            achieve even better for Inter-house Chess, coming a
                            very respectable second.<br />
                            <br />
                            Following the Christmas and New Year Break, Upsdell
                            came out swinging; or shall we say, running,
                            throwing, and jumping! Sports Day being one of our
                            stronger events in the past 5 years, Upsdell was
                            ready to redeem ourselves for past misfortunes. The
                            outstanding participation in this event, as well as
                            our naturally talented runners, brought us all the
                            way up to come in second place! A great effort by
                            all Upsdellians!<br />
                            <br />
                            We weren’t done yet. In March, Upsdellians danced
                            their way into their first House victory in the
                            Evening of Music and Dance. After countless hours of
                            practices, rehearsals and a lot of hard work,
                            Upsdell boys and girls managed to create the best
                            dances of the competition. Whether it was the cute
                            and delightful ‘date at the movies’ dance by the
                            Juniors, or the Seniors’ eerily synchronized
                            fast-paced moves, Upsdell stunned the crowd with
                            their originality, skills and energy! Well done to
                            all those who danced, as well as a special mention
                            to the dance captains, who put in so much time and
                            effort to coordinate one of the biggest competitions
                            of the year.<br />
                            <br />
                            Though the year started off sluggish, a strong house
                            spirit and perseverance saw Upsdell pull together
                            before the end of the year and show some of our true
                            colours (or shall we say, colour, i.e. red!) We wish
                            Upsdell the best of luck in next year’s competition!
                            GO UPSDELL GO!<br />
